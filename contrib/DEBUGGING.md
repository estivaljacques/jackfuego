Sure, here's a more detailed guide on debugging Bittensor, including some code examples from the Bittensor repository.

## Installation

First, make sure you have Bittensor installed correctly. There are three ways to install Bittensor:

1. Through the installer:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opentensor/bittensor/master/scripts/install.sh)"
```

2. With pip:

```bash
pip install bittensor
```

3. From source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opentensor/bittensor.git
python3 -m pip install -e bittensor/
```

You can test your installation by running:

```bash
python3 -c "import bittensor; print(bittensor.__version__)"
```

## Wallets

Bittensor uses wallets for identity and ownership. Wallets consist of a coldkey and hotkey. Coldkeys store funds securely and operate functions such as transfers and staking, while hotkeys are used for all online operations such as signing queries, running miners, and validating.

Here's how to create a wallet using the Python API:

```python
import bittensor as bt
wallet = bt.wallet()
wallet.create_new_coldkey()
wallet.create_new_hotkey()
print(wallet)
```

## Querying the Network

You can query the Bittensor network using the Python API. Here's an example of how to do this:

```python
import bittensor as bt

# Query through the foundation endpoint.
print(bt.prompt("Heraclitus was a "))
```

## Debugging Miners

Miners in Bittensor are incentivized to contribute distinct forms of value determined by the verification mechanism that that subnetworkâ€™s Validators are running. 

Here's an example of how to register a miner:

```bash
btcli register --netuid <subnetwork uid>
```

Once registered, the miner attains a slot specified by their UID. To view your slot after registration, run the overview command:

```bash
btcli overview --netuid <subnetwork uid>
```

Registered miners can select from a variety of pre-written miners or write their own using the Python API. Here's an example of how to run a miner:

```bash
python3 bittensor/neurons/text_prompting/miners/GPT4ALL/neuron.py --netuid 1
```

## Debugging Validators

Validators in Bittensor are participants who hold TAO. They use a dual proof-of-stake, proof-of-work mechanism called Yuma Consensus. Here's how to stake funds:

```bash
btcli stake --help
```

And here's how to become a delegate available for delegated stake:

```bash
btcli nominate --help
```

## Using the CLI

Bittensor comes with a command-line interface (CLI) called `btcli` that you can use to interact with the network. Here's how to get help on the available commands:

```bash
btcli --help
```

## Debugging with the Bittensor Package

The Bittensor package contains data structures for interacting with the Bittensor ecosystem, writing miners, validators, and querying the network. Here's an example of how to use the Bittensor package to create a wallet, connect to the axon running on slot 10, and send a prompt to this endpoint:

```python
import bittensor as bt

# Bittensor's wallet maintenance class.
wallet = bt.wallet()

# Bittensor's chain interface.
subtensor = bt.subtensor()

# Bittensor's chain state object.
metagraph = bt.metagraph(netuid=1)

# Instantiate a Bittensor endpoint.
axon = bt.axon(wallet=wallet, metagraph=metagraph)

# Start servicing messages on the wire.
axon.start()

# Register this axon on a subnetwork
subtensor.serve_axon(netuid=1, axon=axon)

# Connect to the axon running on slot 10, use the wallet to sign messages.
dendrite = bt.text_prompting(keypair=wallet.hotkey, axon=metagraph.axons[10])

# Send a prompt to this endpoint
dendrite.forward(roles=['user'], messages=['what are you?'])
```

Remember, debugging involves a lot of trial and error. Don't be discouraged if things don't work right away. Keep trying different things, and don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it.
